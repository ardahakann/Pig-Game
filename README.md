This is a simple 2-player dice game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective of the game is to accumulate a total score of 100 points. Players take turns rolling a dice, adding the roll to their current score. The first player to reach 100 points wins. If a player rolls a 1, their current score for that turn is lost, and it's the next player's turn.

Dice Rolls: Players can roll the dice to accumulate points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current turn's points.

Score Tracking: Each player's score is displayed on the screen. Players accumulate points as they hold their scores.

Winner Announcement: The game automatically announces the winner once a player reaches 100 points.

Reset Function: The "New Game" button resets the game to its initial state.
